This is the source code for the open source automatic cat feeder versin 4.0.  It makes use of Pimoroni's [Phew!](https://github.com/pimoroni/phew) webserver and templating library - a copy of this is contained in this repository in the `phew` folder.

It uses some code from https://github.com/simonprickett/phewap .

It uses umqtt which is also a good library worth checking out.

It uses above all Micropython, www.micropython.org.
